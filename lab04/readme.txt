What type of objects are going to be in the array?
What size should the array be?
How should the array be sorted? (Ascending/Descending)
Will the array always be full?
What algorithm is required?
Is there an efficiency constraint?
The array should be of type Integer.
The size should be any
The array should be sorted in descending order
The array will always be full
There is no efficiency constraint
There is no output
The array should return a new array in sorted order
